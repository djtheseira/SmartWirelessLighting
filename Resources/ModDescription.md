# SMART Wireless Lighting 

Smart Wireless Lighting takes advantage of the Lighting network from Satisfactory but allows a user to manage and connect to those lights from the SMART Wireless Lighting Control Panel.

![Multiplayer Compatible](https://github.com/deantendo/community/blob/master/com_mp_yes.png?raw=true)

### Unlocked in the Resource Sink Shop in the Organization section where the other Lighting buildables are located. BUT ITS FREEEEEE

# Features

- SMART Wireless Lighting Panel
	
	- This panel is built off the regular Lighting Control Panel, but adds a secondary screen that displays the Lights that are not connected to any other systems and shows the Lights that are connected to the current Control Panel.

# Changelog

   - The sorting I added in .2 messed up the original sorting, so swapped the logic.

### 0.9.2:
   - Changed location of item in the Resource Sink Shop.
   - Fixed the Lights selection boxes so that they're ACTUALLY scrollable.
   - Changed the sorting on Lights so that the ones that are connected are displayed first as well.

### 0.9.1:
   
   - Added a sort method onto the Light list, which sorts the closest Lights first.

### 0.9.0: 

   - Officially in beta, things are working quite nicely. 
   - Fixed multiplayer support and essentially reworked the entire system to ensure that there wasn't a major difference between single and multiplayer. 
   - Changed how connections are made, using a custom power line.
   - Fixed when removing or adding a new Light, the list is properly updated.
   - Fixed issue where destroying a SMART Lighting Panel, the Light list is updated with any Lights that were connected to the destroyed building.

### 0.1.0:

   - Original upload to ficsit.app, was very alpha and needed quite a bit of rework.
