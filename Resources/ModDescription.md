# Features

- SMART Wireless Lighting Control Panel
	
	- This panel is built off the regular Lighting Control Panel, but adds a secondary screen that displays the Lights that are not connected to any other systems and shows the Lights that are connected to the current Control Panel.

# Warning

This mod, just like most other mods, may cause issues with save games. Due to the overall connections between this mod and the built-in fuctionalities from CSS, whenever a major update to the lighting system happens, it can cause loading issues for your world. If you have any issues or bugs related to this mod, please tag me @crouton on discord or create an issue on GitHub describing the problem IMMEDIATELY.
